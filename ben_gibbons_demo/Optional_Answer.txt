To deploy a previously created docker image AWS you can use more or less the same methods used for this task. There are only two key differences. 
1. Instead of pushing your image to a docker registry from the jeinkins pipeline you will be pushing it instead the the AWS service Elastic Container Registry (ECR). 
2. From ECR you can then use the AWS service Elastic Container Service (ECS).

ECR is a docker container registry service provided by AWS and ECS is a container orchestration service which allows you to work with docker images in AWS. 

From ECS you can build your images with either EC2 or Fargate. 

The overall flow would go
Dockerfile -> Docker image -> GitHub -> Jenkins -> ECR -> ECS. 
Jenkins acts as the orchestrator in this process, managing the build and deployment steps of you docker image.
ECR is the registry that stores the image.
ECS is the service that runs your image.
