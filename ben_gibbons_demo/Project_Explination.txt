The build script runs the dockerbuild command based off the dockerfile. The dockerfile builds an image which is based off Ubuntu and installs open JDK17. 

The run.sh script pulls the image from the docker registry, runs the container and runs the graddle commands to build the springboot app.

I created two pipeline scripts. 

pipeline_v1 pulls the code from github and then runs the build.sh script. The image is then pushed to my docker registry but I created two variables. One with a timestamp and the other is the image name with the timestamp added to it. I wanted to create unique images each time the image is pushed to the registry. 

pipeline_v2 then is more basic. It is setup identically to v1 but instead of a unique name for each image pushed instead the one image in the registry is updated with each push. 

Each script uses the withCredentials feature in jenkins to login securely to Docker.
